# Features this API could use
# P0: [✓] No stargazing reports during the day
# P1: [✓] URL for img of nearest CLEAR SKY Chart, none if > 100 miles, display distance to site + name?
# P2: [✓] Allow user to specify what time to check
# P3: [ ] TIME of Next ISS overpass + visibility, az/alt
# P4: [ ] Any planets visible, where (specific + rough locations - i.e. az/art and general direction and height)
# P4: [ ] Key Meisser Objects, and other popular deep sky objects

# Improvements to Code Quality/Standards
# [✓] Lint/Check for PEP-8
# [✓] Isolate API calls in seperate functions
# [ ] Proper Unit Tests, 
# [ ] CI/CD setup
# [ ] Have 3 API endpoints: Stargazing, Driving Distance, CSC (Later: ISS, Planets, Meisser, etc)


# ToDo Tweaks/Optomize
# [✓] get_darkness_times
    # P1: [✓] TODO: Currently only returns darkness times for today, must work for next 48 hours
        # API accepts date paramter but in YYYY-MM-DD format, not unix time
    # P2: [✓] TODO: These times may be meaningless above/below (An)arctic Circle.
        # Check what API results are for arctic locations at different times of year
        # If Midnight Sun, tell user no stargazing possible :(
        # If Polar Night, they can stargaze whenever they want! :)
    # P1: [✓] TODO: I just found out the times here dont explicitly account for Daylight Savings.
        # This may or may not be an issue...
# [ ] get_weather_at_time
    # P3: [ ] TODO: ONLY get data we need from API requests? Would be faster but requires
        # a lot more params in url request used. Probably worth it in the long run
    # P1: [✓] TODO The response from weatherdata is slightly different if looking at future weather report!
        # Test responses at various future times, verify that below keys still exist and get correct values
# [✓] getCDSChart
    # P3 TODO: Use more accurate distance model/equation
# [✓] get_location_data
    # P2 [✓] TODO: Distance and elevation calls should probably be two methods
    # P0 [✓?] TODO: Both GMaps API calls VERY slow... why?
# [ ] calculate_rating
    # P4 [ ] TODO Equation for calulcating the rating needs some work.
    # P4 [ ] TODO Equation can also factor in "elevation" and "visibility" but currently does not
# [ ] get_stargaze_report
    # P3 [ ] TODO User-facing message that time was changed to ___ (w/ TZ adjust!)
    # P1 [✓] TODO Allow users with no entered location to lookup stargazing reports (drop driving distance request)
